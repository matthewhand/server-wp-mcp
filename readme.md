- **REST API Integration**: Full access to WordPress REST API endpoints
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses application passwords for secure API access
- **Dynamic Endpoint Discovery**: Automatically maps available endpoints for each site
- **Flexible Operations**: Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH methods
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with meaningful messages
- **Simple Configuration**: Easy-to-maintain JSON configuration file

## Installation

```bash
npm install server-wp-mcp
```

## Tools Reference

### `wp_discover_endpoints`
Maps all available REST API endpoints on a WordPress site.

**Arguments:**
```json
{
	"site": {
		"type": "string",
		"description": "Site alias (as defined in configuration)",
		"required": true
	}
}
```

**Returns:**
List of available endpoints with their methods and namespaces.

### `wp_call_endpoint`
Executes REST API requests to WordPress sites.

**Arguments:**
```json
{
	"site": {
		"type": "string",
		"description": "Site alias",
		"required": true
	},
	"endpoint": {
		"type": "string",
		"description": "API endpoint path",
		"required": true
	},
	"method": {
		"type": "string",
		"enum": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"],
		"description": "HTTP method",
		"default": "GET"
	},
	"params": {
		"type": "object",
		"description": "Request parameters or body data",
		"required": false
	}
}
```

## Configuration

### Getting an Application Password

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to Users → Profile
3. Scroll to the "Application Passwords" section
4. Enter a name for the application (e.g., "MCP Server")
5. Click "Add New Application Password"
6. Copy the generated password (you won't be able to see it again)

Note: Application Passwords require WordPress 5.6 or later and HTTPS.

### Configuration File Setup

Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `wp-sites.json`) with your WordPress site details:

```json
{
	"myblog": {
		"URL": "https://myblog.com",
		"USER": "yourusername",
		"PASS": "abcd 1234 efgh 5678"
	},
	"testsite": {
		"URL": "https://test.example.com",
		"USER": "anotherusername",
		"PASS": "wxyz 9876 lmno 5432"
	}
}
```

Each site configuration requires:
- `URL`: WordPress site URL (must include http:// or https://)
- `USER`: WordPress username
- `PASS`: Application password (spaces will be automatically removed)

The configuration key (e.g., "myblog", "testsite") becomes the site alias you'll use when interacting with the server.

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"wordpress": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["path/to/server/dist/index.js"],
			"env": {
				"WP_SITES_PATH": "/absolute/path/to/wp-sites.json"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The `WP_SITES_PATH` environment variable must point to the absolute path of your configuration file.

### Example Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude to perform various WordPress operations:

#### List and Query Posts

## Error Handling

The server handles common errors including:
- Invalid configuration file path or format
- Invalid site configurations
- Authentication failures
- Missing or invalid endpoints
- API rate limiting
- Network errors

All errors are returned with descriptive messages to help diagnose issues.

## Security Considerations

- Keep your `wp-sites.json` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive data in production
- Store the config file outside of public directories
- Use HTTPS for all WordPress sites
- Regularly rotate application passwords
- Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles

## Dependencies
